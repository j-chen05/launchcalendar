#Usage guide

You will need your own Google Calendar API key to use this app.
1) Go to https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python and follow step 1 to get your own API key.
2) Download the file. It should save under the filename ```credentials.json```
3) Afterwards, create a ```.env``` file in the main directory.
4) Copy over the contents of the ```.env.default``` file to your newly created ```.env``` file.
5) Open the ```credentials.json``` you downloaded in a text editor.
6) Following the format of the ```.env.default``` file you copied into ```.env```, locate the 
corresponding fields in your ```credentials.json``` and replace the variable values in ```.env``` with these new values.
    - No punctuation - just replace the entire default value with the value from ```credentials.json```

Then, run main.py from your IDE or from command-line:
```python3 main.py```

Then, follow the prompts in the app, and start browsing and scheduling upcoming launches!
